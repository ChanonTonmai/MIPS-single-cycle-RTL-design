2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
DPIP-1#1 Warning
Input pipelining  
DSP mipsAlu_32/D0 input mipsAlu_32/D0/A[29:0] is not pipelined. Pipelining DSP48 input will improve performance.
Related violations: <none>

DPIP-1#2 Warning
Input pipelining  
DSP mipsAlu_32/D0 input mipsAlu_32/D0/B[17:0] is not pipelined. Pipelining DSP48 input will improve performance.
Related violations: <none>

DPIP-1#3 Warning
Input pipelining  
DSP mipsAlu_32/D0__0 input mipsAlu_32/D0__0/A[29:0] is not pipelined. Pipelining DSP48 input will improve performance.
Related violations: <none>

DPIP-1#4 Warning
Input pipelining  
DSP mipsAlu_32/D0__0 input mipsAlu_32/D0__0/B[17:0] is not pipelined. Pipelining DSP48 input will improve performance.
Related violations: <none>

DPIP-1#5 Warning
Input pipelining  
DSP mipsAlu_32/D0__1 input mipsAlu_32/D0__1/A[29:0] is not pipelined. Pipelining DSP48 input will improve performance.
Related violations: <none>

DPIP-1#6 Warning
Input pipelining  
DSP mipsAlu_32/D0__1 input mipsAlu_32/D0__1/B[17:0] is not pipelined. Pipelining DSP48 input will improve performance.
Related violations: <none>

DPOP-1#1 Warning
PREG Output pipelining  
DSP mipsAlu_32/D0 output mipsAlu_32/D0/P[47:0] is not pipelined (PREG=0). Pipelining the DSP48 output will improve performance and often saves power so it is suggested whenever possible to fully pipeline this function.  If this DSP48 function was inferred, it is suggested to describe an additional register stage after this function.  If the DSP48 was instantiated in the design, it is suggested to set the PREG attribute to 1.
Related violations: <none>

DPOP-1#2 Warning
PREG Output pipelining  
DSP mipsAlu_32/D0__0 output mipsAlu_32/D0__0/P[47:0] is not pipelined (PREG=0). Pipelining the DSP48 output will improve performance and often saves power so it is suggested whenever possible to fully pipeline this function.  If this DSP48 function was inferred, it is suggested to describe an additional register stage after this function.  If the DSP48 was instantiated in the design, it is suggested to set the PREG attribute to 1.
Related violations: <none>

DPOP-1#3 Warning
PREG Output pipelining  
DSP mipsAlu_32/D0__1 output mipsAlu_32/D0__1/P[47:0] is not pipelined (PREG=0). Pipelining the DSP48 output will improve performance and often saves power so it is suggested whenever possible to fully pipeline this function.  If this DSP48 function was inferred, it is suggested to describe an additional register stage after this function.  If the DSP48 was instantiated in the design, it is suggested to set the PREG attribute to 1.
Related violations: <none>

DPOP-2#1 Warning
MREG Output pipelining  
DSP mipsAlu_32/D0 multiplier stage mipsAlu_32/D0/P[47:0] is not pipelined (MREG=0). Pipelining the multiplier function will improve performance and will save significant power so it is suggested whenever possible to fully pipeline this function.  If this multiplier was inferred, it is suggested to describe an additional register stage after this function.  If there is no registered adder/accumulator following the multiply function, two pipeline stages are suggested to allow both the MREG and PREG registers to be used.  If the DSP48 was instantiated in the design, it is suggested to set both the MREG and PREG attributes to 1 when performing multiply functions.
Related violations: <none>

DPOP-2#2 Warning
MREG Output pipelining  
DSP mipsAlu_32/D0__0 multiplier stage mipsAlu_32/D0__0/P[47:0] is not pipelined (MREG=0). Pipelining the multiplier function will improve performance and will save significant power so it is suggested whenever possible to fully pipeline this function.  If this multiplier was inferred, it is suggested to describe an additional register stage after this function.  If there is no registered adder/accumulator following the multiply function, two pipeline stages are suggested to allow both the MREG and PREG registers to be used.  If the DSP48 was instantiated in the design, it is suggested to set both the MREG and PREG attributes to 1 when performing multiply functions.
Related violations: <none>

DPOP-2#3 Warning
MREG Output pipelining  
DSP mipsAlu_32/D0__1 multiplier stage mipsAlu_32/D0__1/P[47:0] is not pipelined (MREG=0). Pipelining the multiplier function will improve performance and will save significant power so it is suggested whenever possible to fully pipeline this function.  If this multiplier was inferred, it is suggested to describe an additional register stage after this function.  If there is no registered adder/accumulator following the multiply function, two pipeline stages are suggested to allow both the MREG and PREG registers to be used.  If the DSP48 was instantiated in the design, it is suggested to set both the MREG and PREG attributes to 1 when performing multiply functions.

PDRC-153#1 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net ctrlMIPS/ALUSrc_reg_i_2_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin ctrlMIPS/ALUSrc_reg_i_2/O, cell ctrlMIPS/ALUSrc_reg_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#2 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net ctrlMIPS/E[0] is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin ctrlMIPS/mult_temp_reg[31]_i_2/O, cell ctrlMIPS/mult_temp_reg[31]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#3 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net ctrlMIPS/MemWrite_reg_i_2_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin ctrlMIPS/MemWrite_reg_i_2/O, cell ctrlMIPS/MemWrite_reg_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#4 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net ctrlMIPS/MemWrite_reg_i_3_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin ctrlMIPS/MemWrite_reg_i_3/O, cell ctrlMIPS/MemWrite_reg_i_3. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#5 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net ctrlMIPS/RegDst_reg/G0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin ctrlMIPS/RegDst_reg/L3_2/O, cell ctrlMIPS/RegDst_reg/L3_2 (in ctrlMIPS/RegDst_reg macro). This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#6 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net ctrlMIPS/RegDst_reg_i_1_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin ctrlMIPS/RegDst_reg_i_1/O, cell ctrlMIPS/RegDst_reg_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#7 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net ctrlMIPS/SpecialMemOp_reg[2]_i_2_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin ctrlMIPS/SpecialMemOp_reg[2]_i_2/O, cell ctrlMIPS/SpecialMemOp_reg[2]_i_2.
